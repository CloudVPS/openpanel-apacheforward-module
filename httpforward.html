  You can forward or redirect http requests to existing websites. A
  redirect can be useful when you want to encourage people who access
  your site through a secondary domain to start associating it with
  the redirected-to domain. A forward can be used if you want to add an
  equivalent domain for a site that runs on another server outside of
  your direct control.
